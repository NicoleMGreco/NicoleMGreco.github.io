I'm so happy you're here! I'm Nicole, a glacial geologist and science communicator living in sunny Santa Barbara, California. I currently serve as a Community Engagement & Outreach Coordinator for the NSF Arctic Data Center and the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis Learning Hub. I'm an avid hiker, painter, puzzle-doer, and sea glass collector. Poke around my website to learn more!
